### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 My name is Georgios Anyfantis. I just graduated with an Msci Computer Science from Loughborough University.

 I am interested in Artificial Intelligence and its application in Cybersecurity, Networking, Cloud Computing and Cloud Security.

 I have previously worked on the creation of a simple DNN for attack detection using the CIC-IDS-2017. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/georgeani/NIDS_Dissertation_2021)

 In my profile, you can find all my projects.
